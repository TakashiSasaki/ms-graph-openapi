  description: >-
    Complete the message migration process by removing migration mode from a
    team. Migration mode is a special state where certain operations are barred,
    like message POST and membership operations during the data migration
    process. After a completeMigration request is made, you can't import
    additional messages into the team. You can add members to the team after the
    request returns a successful response.
