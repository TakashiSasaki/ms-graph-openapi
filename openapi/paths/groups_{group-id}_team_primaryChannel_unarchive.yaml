  description: >-
    Restore an archived channel. Unarchiving restores the ability for users to
    send messages and edit the channel. Channels are archived via the channel:
    archive method. Unarchiving is an asynchronous operation; a channel is
    unarchived when the asynchronous unarchiving operation completes
    successfully, which might occur after this method responds.
