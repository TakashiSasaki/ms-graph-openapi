      activeSignInUri:
        type: string
        description: >-
          URL of the endpoint used by active clients when authenticating with
          federated domains set up for single sign-on in Microsoft Entra ID.
          Corresponds to the ActiveLogOnUri property of the
          Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings MSOnline v1 PowerShell cmdlet.
        nullable: true
      federatedIdpMfaBehavior:
        anyOf:

          - type: object
            nullable: true
        description: >-
          Determines whether Microsoft Entra ID accepts the MFA performed by the
          federated IdP when a federated user accesses an application that is
          governed by a conditional access policy that requires MFA. The
          possible values are: acceptIfMfaDoneByFederatedIdp,
          enforceMfaByFederatedIdp, rejectMfaByFederatedIdp, unknownFutureValue.
          For more information, see federatedIdpMfaBehavior values.
      isSignedAuthenticationRequestRequired:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          If true, when SAML authentication requests are sent to the federated
          SAML IdP, Microsoft Entra ID will sign those requests using the OrgID
          signing key. If false (default), the SAML authentication requests sent
          to the federated IdP aren't signed.
        nullable: true
      nextSigningCertificate:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Fallback token signing certificate that can also be used to sign
          tokens, for example when the primary signing certificate expires.
          Formatted as Base64 encoded strings of the public portion of the
          federated IdP's token signing certificate. Needs to be compatible with
          the X509Certificate2 class. Much like the signingCertificate, the
          nextSigningCertificate property is used if a rollover is required
          outside of the auto-rollover update, a new federation service is being
          set up, or if the new token signing certificate isn't present in the
          federation properties after the federation service certificate has
          been updated.

          - type: object
            nullable: true
        description: >-
          Sets the preferred behavior for the sign-in prompt. The possible
          values are: translateToFreshPasswordAuthentication, nativeSupport,
          disabled, unknownFutureValue.
      signingCertificateUpdateStatus:
        anyOf:
          - $ref: .\microsoft.graph.signingCertificateUpdateStatus.yaml
          - type: object
            nullable: true
        description: >-
          Provides status and timestamp of the last update of the signing
          certificate.
      signOutUri:
        type: string
        description: >-
          URI that clients are redirected to when they sign out of Microsoft
          Entra services. Corresponds to the LogOffUri property of the
          Set-MsolDomainFederationSettings MSOnline v1 PowerShell cmdlet.
