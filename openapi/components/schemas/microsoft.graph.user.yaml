          attributes are also known as Exchange custom attributes 1-15. Each
          attribute can store up to 1024 characters. For an
          onPremisesSyncEnabled user, the source of authority for this set of
          properties is the on-premises and is read-only. For a cloud-only user
          (where onPremisesSyncEnabled is false), these properties can be set
          during the creation or update of a user object.  For a cloud-only user
          previously synced from on-premises Active Directory, these properties
          are read-only in Microsoft Graph but can be fully managed through the
          Exchange Admin Center or the Exchange Online V2 module in PowerShell.
