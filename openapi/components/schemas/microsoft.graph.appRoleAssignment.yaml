          The identifier (id) for the app role that's assigned to the principal.
          This app role must be exposed in the appRoles property on the resource
          application's service principal (resourceId). If the resource
          application hasn't declared any app roles, a default app role ID of
          00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 can be specified to signal that
          the principal is assigned to the resource app without any specific app
          roles. Required on create.
