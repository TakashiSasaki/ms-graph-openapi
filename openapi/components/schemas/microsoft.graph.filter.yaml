      *Experimental* Filter group set used to decide whether given object

      Filter group set used to decide whether given object is in scope for
      provisioning. This is the filter which should be used in most cases. If an
      object used to satisfy this filter at a given moment, and then the object
      or the filter was changed so that filter isn't satisfied any longer, such
      object will get deprovisioned'. An object is considered in scope if ANY of
      the groups in the collection is evaluated to true.

    description: >-
      *Experimental* Filter group set used to filter out objects at the early
      stage of reading them from the directory. If an object doesn't satisfy
      this filter, then it will not be processed further. Important to
      understand is that if an object used to satisfy this filter at a given
      moment, and then the object or the filter was changed so that filter is no
      longer satisfied, such object will NOT get deprovisioned. An object is
      considered in scope if ANY of the groups in the collection is evaluated to
      true.
