        description: >-
          Identifier of the app specific scope when the assignment scope is app
          specific. The scope of an assignment determines the set of resources
          for which the principal has been granted access. App scopes are scopes
          that are defined and understood by a resource application only. For
          the entitlement management provider, use this property to specify a
          catalog. For example,
          /AccessPackageCatalog/beedadfe-01d5-4025-910b-84abb9369997. Supports
          $filter (eq, in). For example,
          /roleManagement/entitlementManagement/roleAssignments?$filter=appScopeId
          eq '/AccessPackageCatalog/{catalog id}'.

          Identifier of the directory object representing the scope of the

          for which the principal has been granted access. Directory scopes are
          shared scopes stored in the directory that are understood by multiple
          applications, unlike app scopes that are defined and understood by a
          resource application only. Supports $filter (eq, in).
