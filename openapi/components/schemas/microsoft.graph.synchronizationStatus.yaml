  escrowsPruned:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      true if the job's escrows (object-level errors) were pruned during initial
      synchronization. Escrows can be pruned if during the initial
      synchronization, you reach the threshold of errors that would normally put
      the job in quarantine. Instead of going into quarantine, the
      synchronization process clears the job's errors and continues until the
      initial synchronization is completed. When the initial synchronization is
      completed, the job will pause and wait for the customer to clean up the
      errors.
