    description: >-
      The Role Definition resource. The role definition is the foundation of
      role based access in Intune. The role combines an Intune resource such as
      a Mobile App and associated role permissions such as Create or Read for
      the resource. There are two types of roles, built-in and custom. Built-in
      roles cannot be modified. Both built-in roles and custom roles must have
      assignments to be enforced. Create custom roles if you want to define a
      role that allows any of the available resources and role permissions to be
      combined into a single role.
