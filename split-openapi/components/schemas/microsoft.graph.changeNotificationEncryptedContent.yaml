    type: string
    description: >-
      Base64-encoded encrypted data that produces a full resource respresented
      as JSON. The data has been encrypted with the provided dataKey using an
      AES/CBC/PKCS5PADDING cipher suite.
  dataKey:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Base64-encoded symmetric key generated by Microsoft Graph to encrypt the
      data value and to generate the data signature. This key is encrypted with
      the certificate public key that was provided during the subscription. It
      must be decrypted with the certificate private key before it can be used
      to decrypt the data or verify the signature. This key has been encrypted
      with the following cipher suite: RSA/ECB/OAEPWithSHA1AndMGF1Padding.
  dataSignature:
    type: string
    description: Base64-encoded HMAC-SHA256 hash of the data for validation purposes.
  encryptionCertificateId:
    type: string
    description: ID of the certificate used to encrypt the dataKey.
  encryptionCertificateThumbprint:
    type: string
    description: >-
      Hexadecimal representation of the thumbprint of the certificate used to
      encrypt the dataKey.
