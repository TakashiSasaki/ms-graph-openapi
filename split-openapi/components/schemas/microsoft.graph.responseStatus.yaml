      The response type. Possible values are: none, organizer,
      tentativelyAccepted, accepted, declined, notResponded.To differentiate
      between none and notResponded:  none – from organizer's perspective. This
      value is used when the status of an attendee/participant is reported to
      the organizer of a meeting.  notResponded – from attendee's perspective.
      Indicates the attendee has not responded to the meeting request.  Clients
      can treat notResponded == none.  As an example, if attendee Alex hasn't
      responded to a meeting request, getting Alex' response status for that
      event in Alex' calendar returns notResponded. Getting Alex' response from
      the calendar of any other attendee or the organizer's returns none.
      Getting the organizer's response for the event in anybody's calendar also
      returns none.
