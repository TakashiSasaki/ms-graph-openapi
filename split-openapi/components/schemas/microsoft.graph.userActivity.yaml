    properties:
      activationUrl:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Required. URL used to launch the activity in the best native
          experience represented by the appId. Might launch a web-based app if
          no native app exists.
      activitySourceHost:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Required. URL for the domain representing the cross-platform identity
          mapping for the app. Mapping is stored either as a JSON file hosted on
          the domain or configurable via Windows Dev Center. The JSON file is
          named cross-platform-app-identifiers and is hosted at root of your
          HTTPS domain, either at the top level domain or include a sub domain.
          For example: https://contoso.com or https://myapp.contoso.com but NOT
          https://myapp.contoso.com/somepath. You must have a unique file and
          domain (or sub domain) per cross-platform app identity. For example, a
          separate file and domain is needed for Word vs. PowerPoint.
