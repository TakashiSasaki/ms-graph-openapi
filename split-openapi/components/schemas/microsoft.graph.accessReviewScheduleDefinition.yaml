          This collection of reviewer scopes is used to define the list of
          fallback reviewers. These fallback reviewers are notified to take
          action if no users are found from the list of reviewers specified.
          This could occur when either the group owner is specified as the
          reviewer but the group owner doesn't exist, or manager is specified as
          reviewer but a user's manager doesn't exist. See
          accessReviewReviewerScope. Replaces backupReviewers. Supports $select.
          NOTE: The value of this property will be ignored if fallback reviewers
          are assigned through the stageSettings property.

          This property is required when scoping a review to guest users' access
          across all Microsoft 365 groups and determines which Microsoft 365
          groups are reviewed. Each group becomes a unique accessReviewInstance
          of the access review series.  For supported scopes, see
          accessReviewScope. Supports $select. For examples of options for
          configuring instanceEnumerationScope, see Configure the scope of your

          sequentially based on the dependsOn property. Optional.  When this

          review has multiple resources and multiple instances, each resource
          has a unique instance for each recurrence.
