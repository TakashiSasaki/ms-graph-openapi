        type: array
        items:
          type: string
        description: >-
          The audience that can appear in the external token. This field is
          mandatory and should be set to api://AzureADTokenExchange for
          Microsoft Entra ID. It says what Microsoft identity platform should
          accept in the aud claim in the incoming token. This value represents
          Microsoft Entra ID in your external identity provider and has no fixed
          value across identity providers - you might need to create a new
          application registration in your identity provider to serve as the
          audience of this token. This field can only accept a single value and
          has a limit of 600 characters. Required.
      description:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The unvalidated description of the federated identity credential,
          provided by the user. It has a limit of 600 characters. Optional.
        nullable: true
      issuer:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The URL of the external identity provider, which must match the issuer
          claim of the external token being exchanged. The combination of the
          values of issuer and subject must be unique within the app. It has a
          limit of 600 characters. Required.
      name:
        type: string
        description: >-
          The unique identifier for the federated identity credential, which has
          a limit of 120 characters and must be URL friendly. The string is
          immutable after it's created. Alternate key. Required. Not nullable.
          Supports $filter (eq).
      subject:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Required. The identifier of the external software workload within the
          external identity provider. Like the audience value, it has no fixed
          format; each identity provider uses their own - sometimes a GUID,
          sometimes a colon delimited identifier, sometimes arbitrary strings.
          The value here must match the sub claim within the token presented to
          Microsoft Entra ID. The combination of issuer and subject must be
          unique within the app. It has a limit of 600 characters. Supports
          $filter (eq).
