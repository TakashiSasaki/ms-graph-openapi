    description: >-
      A collection of byte ranges that the server is missing for the file. These
      ranges are zero indexed and of the format 'start-end' (for example '0-26'
      to indicate the first 27 bytes of the file). When uploading files as
      Outlook attachments, instead of a collection of ranges, this property
      always indicates a single value '{start}', the location in the file where
      the next upload should begin.
  uploadUrl:
