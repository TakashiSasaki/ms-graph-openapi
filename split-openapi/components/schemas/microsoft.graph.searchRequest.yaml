type: object
properties:
  aggregationFilters:
    type: array
    items:
      type: string
      nullable: true
    description: >-
      Contains one or more filters to obtain search results aggregated and
      filtered to a specific value of a field. Optional.Build this filter based
      on a prior search that aggregates by the same field. From the response of
      the prior search, identify the searchBucket that filters results to the
      specific value of the field, use the string in its aggregationFilterToken
      property, and build an aggregation filter string in the format
      '{field}:/'{aggregationFilterToken}/''. If multiple values for the same
      field need to be provided, use the strings in its aggregationFilterToken
      property and build an aggregation filter string in the format
      '{field}:or(/'{aggregationFilterToken1}/',/'{aggregationFilterToken2}/')'.
      For example, searching and aggregating drive items by file type returns a
      searchBucket for the file type docx in the response. You can conveniently
      use the aggregationFilterToken returned for this searchBucket in a
      subsequent search query and filter matches down to drive items of the docx
      file type. Example 1 and example 2 show the actual requests and responses.
