  In macOS 12 and later, this command uses Erase All Content and Settings (EACS)
  on Mac computers with the Apple M1 chip or the Apple T2 Security Chip. On
  those devices, if EACS can’t run, the device can use obliteration (macOS 11.x
  behavior). This key has no effect on machines prior to the T2 chip. Upon
  receiving this command, the device performs preflight checks to determine if
  the device is in a state that allows EACS. The ObliterationBehavior value
  defines the device's fallback behavior.

        Default. If Erase All Content and Settings (EACS) preflight fails, the
        device responds to the server with an Error status and then attempts to
        erase itself. If EACS preflight succeeds but EACS fails, then the device
        attempts to erase itself.
