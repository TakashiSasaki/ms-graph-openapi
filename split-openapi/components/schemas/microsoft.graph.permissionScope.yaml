      When you create or update a permission, this property must be set to true
      (which is the default). To delete a permission, this property must first
      be set to false.  At that point, in a subsequent call, the permission may
      be removed.

      The possible values are: User and Admin. Specifies whether this delegated
      permission should be considered safe for non-admin users to consent to on
      behalf of themselves, or whether an administrator consent should always be
      required. While Microsoft Graph defines the default consent requirement
      for each permission, the tenant administrator may override the behavior in
      their organization (by allowing, restricting, or limiting user consent to
      this delegated permission). For more information, see Configure how users
      consent to applications.
