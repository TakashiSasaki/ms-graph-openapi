          Specifies how the provisioned Cloud PC joins to Microsoft Entra. It
          includes different types, one is Microsoft Entra ID join, which means
          there's no on-premises Active Directory (AD) in the current tenant,
          and the Cloud PC device is joined by Microsoft Entra. Another one is
          hybridAzureADJoin, which means there's also an on-premises Active
          Directory (AD) in the current tenant and the Cloud PC device joins to
          on-premises Active Directory (AD) and Microsoft Entra. The type also
          determines which types of users can be assigned and can sign into a
          Cloud PC. The azureADJoin type indicates that cloud-only and hybrid
          users can be assigned and signed into the Cloud PC. hybridAzureADJoin
          indicates only hybrid users can be assigned and signed into the Cloud
          PC. The default value is hybridAzureADJoin.
