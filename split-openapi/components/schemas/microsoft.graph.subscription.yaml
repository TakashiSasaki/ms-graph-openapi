    type: object
    properties:
      applicationId:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Optional. Identifier of the application used to create the
          subscription. Read-only.
        nullable: true
      changeType:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Required. Indicates the type of change in the subscribed resource that
          raises a change notification. The supported values are: created,
          updated, deleted. Multiple values can be combined using a
          comma-separated list. Note:  Drive root item and list change
          notifications support only the updated changeType. User and group
          change notifications support updated and deleted changeType. Use
          updated to receive notifications when user or group is created,
          updated, or soft deleted. Use deleted to receive notifications when
          user or group is permanently deleted.
      clientState:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Optional. Specifies the value of the clientState property sent by the
          service in each change notification. The maximum length is 128
          characters. The client can check that the change notification came
          from the service by comparing the value of the clientState property
          sent with the subscription with the value of the clientState property
          received with each change notification.
        nullable: true
      creatorId:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Optional. Identifier of the user or service principal that created the
          subscription. If the app used delegated permissions to create the
          subscription, this field contains the ID of the signed-in user the app
          called on behalf of. If the app used application permissions, this
          field contains the ID of the service principal corresponding to the
          app. Read-only.
        nullable: true
      encryptionCertificate:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Optional. A base64-encoded representation of a certificate with a
          public key used to encrypt resource data in change notifications.
          Optional but required when includeResourceData is true.
        nullable: true
      encryptionCertificateId:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Optional. A custom app-provided identifier to help identify the
          certificate needed to decrypt resource data.
        nullable: true
      expirationDateTime:
        pattern: >-
          ^[0-9]{4,}-(0[1-9]|1[012])-(0[1-9]|[12][0-9]|3[01])T([01][0-9]|2[0-3]):[0-5][0-9]:[0-5][0-9]([.][0-9]{1,12})?(Z|[+-][0-9][0-9]:[0-9][0-9])$
        type: string
        description: >-
          Required. Specifies the date and time when the webhook subscription
          expires. The time is in UTC, and can be an amount of time from
          subscription creation that varies for the resource subscribed to. For
          the maximum supported subscription length of time, see Subscription
          lifetime.
        format: date-time
      includeResourceData:
        type: boolean
        description: >-
          Optional. When set to true, change notifications include resource data
          (such as content of a chat message).
        nullable: true
      latestSupportedTlsVersion:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Optional. Specifies the latest version of Transport Layer Security
          (TLS) that the notification endpoint, specified by notificationUrl,
          supports. The possible values are: v10, v11, v12, v13. For subscribers
          whose notification endpoint supports a version lower than the
          currently recommended version (TLS 1.2), specifying this property by a
          set timeline allows them to temporarily use their deprecated version
          of TLS before completing their upgrade to TLS 1.2. For these
          subscribers, not setting this property per the timeline would result
          in subscription operations failing. For subscribers whose notification
          endpoint already supports TLS 1.2, setting this property is optional.
          In such cases, Microsoft Graph defaults the property to v1_2.
        nullable: true
      lifecycleNotificationUrl:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Required for Teams resources if  the expirationDateTime value is more
          than 1 hour from now; optional otherwise. The URL of the endpoint that
          receives lifecycle notifications, including subscriptionRemoved,
          reauthorizationRequired, and missed notifications. This URL must make
          use of the HTTPS protocol. For more information, see Reduce missing
          subscriptions and change notifications.
        nullable: true
      notificationQueryOptions:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Optional. OData query options for specifying value for the targeting
          resource. Clients receive notifications when resource reaches the
          state matching the query options provided here. With this new property
          in the subscription creation payload along with all existing
          properties, Webhooks deliver notifications whenever a resource reaches
          the desired state mentioned in the notificationQueryOptions property.
          For example, when the print job is completed or when a print job
          resource isFetchable property value becomes true etc.  Supported only
          for Universal Print Service. For more information, see Subscribe to
          change notifications from cloud printing APIs using Microsoft Graph.
        nullable: true
      notificationUrl:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Required. The URL of the endpoint that receives the change
          notifications. This URL must make use of the HTTPS protocol. Any query
          string parameter included in the notificationUrl property is included
          in the HTTP POST request when Microsoft Graph sends the change
          notifications.
      notificationUrlAppId:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Optional. The app ID that the subscription service can use to generate
          the validation token. The value allows the client to validate the
          authenticity of the notification received.
        nullable: true
      resource:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Required. Specifies the resource that is monitored for changes. Don't
          include the base URL (https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/). See the
          possible resource path values for each supported resource.
