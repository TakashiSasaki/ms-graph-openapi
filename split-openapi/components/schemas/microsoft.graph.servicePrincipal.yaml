          three different values: Application - A service principal that
          represents an application or service. The appId property identifies
          the associated app registration, and matches the appId of an
          application, possibly from a different tenant. If the associated app
          registration is missing, tokens aren't issued for the service
          principal.ManagedIdentity - A service principal that represents a
          managed identity. Service principals representing managed identities
          can be granted access and permissions, but can't be updated or
          modified directly.Legacy - A service principal that represents an app
          created before app registrations, or through legacy experiences. A
          legacy service principal can have credentials, service principal
          names, reply URLs, and other properties that are editable by an
          authorized user, but doesn't have an associated app registration. The
          appId value doesn't associate the service principal with an app
          registration. The service principal can only be used in the tenant
          where it was created.SocialIdp - For internal use.
