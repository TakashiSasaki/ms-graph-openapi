    description: >-
      true if the attribute should be used as the anchor for the object. Anchor
      attributes must have a unique value identifying an object, and must be
      immutable. Default is false. One, and only one, of the object's attributes
      must be designated as the anchor to support synchronization.

  caseExact:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      true if value of this attribute should be treated as case-sensitive. This
      setting affects how the synchronization engine detects changes for the
      attribute.

      For attributes with reference type, lists referenced objects (for example,
      the manager attribute would list User as the referenced object).
  required:
    type: boolean
    description: >-
      true if attribute is required. Object can not be created if any of the
      required attributes are missing. If during synchronization, the required
      attribute has no value, the default value will be used. If default the
      value was not set, synchronization will record an error.
