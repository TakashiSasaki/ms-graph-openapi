      A termsAndConditions entity represents the metadata and contents of a
      given Terms and Conditions (T&C) policy. T&C policiesâ€™ contents are
      presented to users upon their first attempt to enroll into Intune and
      subsequently upon edits where an administrator has required re-acceptance.
      They enable administrators to communicate the provisions to which a user
      must agree in order to have devices enrolled into Intune.
