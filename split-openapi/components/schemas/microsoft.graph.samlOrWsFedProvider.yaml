      signingCertificate:
        type: string
        description: >-
          Current certificate used to sign tokens passed to the Microsoft
          identity platform. The certificate is formatted as a Base64 encoded
          string of the public portion of the federated IdP's token signing
          certificate and must be compatible with the X509Certificate2 class.  
          This property is used in the following scenarios:  if a rollover is
          required outside of the autorollover update a new federation service
          is being set up  if the new token signing certificate isn't present in
          the federation properties after the federation service certificate has
          been updated.   Microsoft Entra ID updates certificates via an
          autorollover process in which it attempts to retrieve a new
          certificate from the federation service metadata, 30 days before
          expiry of the current certificate. If a new certificate isn't
          available, Microsoft Entra ID monitors the metadata daily and will
          update the federation settings for the domain when a new certificate
          is available.
