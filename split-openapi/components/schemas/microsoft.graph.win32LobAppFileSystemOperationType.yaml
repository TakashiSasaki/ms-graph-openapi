x-ms-enum:
  name: win32LobAppFileSystemOperationType
  modelAsString: false
  values:
    - value: notConfigured
      description: >-
        Default. Indicates that the rule does not have the operation type
        configured.
      name: notConfigured
    - value: exists
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule evaluates whether the specified file or folder
        exists.
      name: exists
    - value: modifiedDate
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule compares the modified date of the specified file
        against a provided comparison value by DateTime comparison.
      name: modifiedDate
    - value: createdDate
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule compares the created date of the specified file
        against a provided comparison value by DateTime comparison.
      name: createdDate
    - value: version
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule compares the detected version of the specified
        file against a provided comparison value via version semantics (both
        operand values will be parsed as versions and directly compared). If the
        value read at the given registry value is not discovered to be in
        version-compatible format, a string comparison will be used instead.
      name: version
    - value: sizeInMB
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule compares the size of the file in MiB (rounded
        down) against a provided comparison value by integer comparison.
