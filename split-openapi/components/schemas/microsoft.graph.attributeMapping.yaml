      If higher than 0, this attribute will be used to perform an initial match
      of the objects between source and target directories. The synchronization
      engine will try to find the matching object using attribute with lowest
      value of matching priority first. If not found, the attribute with the
      next matching priority will be used, and so on a until match is found or
      no more matching attributes are left. Only attributes that are expected to
      have unique values, such as email, should be used as matching attributes.
