description: >-
  A list of possible operations for rules used to make determinations about an
  application based on registry keys or values. Unless noted, the values can be
  used with either detection or requirement rules.
x-ms-enum:
  name: win32LobAppRegistryRuleOperationType
  modelAsString: false
  values:
    - value: notConfigured
      description: >-
        Default. Indicates that the rule does not have the operation type
        configured.
      name: notConfigured
    - value: exists
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule evaluates whether the specified registry key or
        value exists.
      name: exists
    - value: doesNotExist
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule evaluates whether the specified registry key or
        value does not exist. It is the functional inverse of an equivalent rule
        that uses operation type `exists`.
      name: doesNotExist
    - value: string
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule compares the value read at the given registry
        value against a provided comparison value by string comparison.
      name: string
    - value: integer
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule compares the value read at the given registry
        value against a provided comparison value by integer comparison.
      name: integer
    - value: version
      description: >-
        Indicates that the rule compares the value read at the given registry
        value against a provided comparison value via version semantics (both
        operand values will be parsed as versions and directly compared). If the
        value read at the given registry value is not discovered to be in
        version-compatible format, a string comparison will be used instead.
