  summary: Invoke action reject
  description: >-
    Enable a bot to reject an incoming call. The incoming call request can be an
    invite from a participant in a group call or a peer-to-peer call. If an
    invite to a group call is received, the notification will contain the
    chatInfo and meetingInfo parameters. The bot is expected to answer or reject
    the call before the call times out. The current timeout value is 15 seconds.
    This API does not end existing calls that have already been answered. Use
    delete call to end a call.
