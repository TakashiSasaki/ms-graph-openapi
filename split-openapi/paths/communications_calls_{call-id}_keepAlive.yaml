  summary: Invoke action keepAlive
  description: >-
    Make a request to this API every 15 to 45 minutes to ensure that an ongoing
    call remains active. A call that does not receive this request within 45
    minutes is considered inactive and will subsequently end. At least one
    successful request must be made within 45 minutes of the previous request,
    or the start of the call. We recommend that you send a request in shorter
    time intervals (every 15 minutes). Make sure that these requests are
    successful to prevent the call from timing out and ending. Attempting to
    send a request to a call that has already ended will result in a 404
    Not-Found error. The resources related to the call should be cleaned up on
    the application side.
