  summary: List assignments of a user
  description: >-
    Returns a list of educationAssignment assigned to a educationUser for all
    classes. Only teachers, students, and applications with application
    permissions can perform this operation. This method allows a caller to find
    all the assignments belonging to a student or a teacher in a single call
    rather than having to request assignments from each class. The assignment
    list contains what is needed to get the detailed information for the
    assignment from within the class namespace. Use the methods defined for the
    assignment for all other operations.
