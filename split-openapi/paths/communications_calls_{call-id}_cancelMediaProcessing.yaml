  summary: Invoke action cancelMediaProcessing
  description: >-
    Cancels processing for any in-progress media operations. Media operations
    refer to the IVR operations playPrompt and recordResponse, which are by
    default queued to process in order. The cancelMediaProcessing method cancels
    any operation that is in-process as well as operations that are queued. For
    example, this method can be used to clean up the IVR operation queue for a
    new media operation. However, it will not cancel a subscribeToTone operation
    because it operates independent of any operation queue.
