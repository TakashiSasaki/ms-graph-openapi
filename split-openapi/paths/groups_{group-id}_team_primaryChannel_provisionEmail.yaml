  summary: Invoke action provisionEmail
  description: >-
    Provision an email address for a channel. Microsoft Teams doesn't
    automatically provision an email address for a channel by default. To have
    Teams provision an email address, you can call provisionEmail, or through
    the Teams user interface, select Get email address, which triggers Teams to
    generate an email address if it has not already provisioned one. To remove
    the email address of a channel, use the removeEmail method.
