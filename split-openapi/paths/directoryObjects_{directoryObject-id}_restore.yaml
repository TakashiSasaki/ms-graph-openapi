  summary: Invoke action restore
  description: >-
    Restore a recently deleted application, group, servicePrincipal,
    administrative unit, or user object from deleted items. If an item was
    accidentally deleted, you can fully restore the item. However, security
    groups can't be restored. Also, restoring an application doesn't restore the
    associated service principal automatically. You must call this API to
    explicitly restore the deleted service principal. A recently deleted item
    remains available for up to 30 days. After 30 days, the item is permanently
    deleted.
