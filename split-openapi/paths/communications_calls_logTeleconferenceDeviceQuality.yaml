  description: >-
    Log video teleconferencing device quality data. The Cloud Video Interop
    (CVI) bot represents video teleconferencing (VTC) devices and acts as a
    back-to-back agent for a VTC device in a conference call. Because a CVI bot
    is in the middle of the VTC and Microsoft Teams infrastructure as a VTC
    proxy, it has two media legs. One media leg is between the CVI bot and Teams
    infrastructure, such as Teams conference server or a Teams client. The other
    media leg is between the CVI bot and the VTC device.  The third-party
    partners own the VTC media leg and the Teams infrastructure cannot access
    the quality data of the third-party call leg.  This method is only for the
    CVI partners to provide their media quality data.
