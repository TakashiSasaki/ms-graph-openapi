  summary: Invoke action reassign
  description: >-
    Reassign the submission to the student with feedback for review. Only
    teachers can perform this action.  Include the Prefer:
    include-unknown-enum-members header when you call this method; otherwise, a
    reassigned submission is treated as a returned submission. This means that
    the reassigned status is mapped to the returned status, and
    reassignedDateTime and reassignedBy properties are mapped to
    returnedDateTime and returnedBy respectively. If the header Prefer:
    include-unknown-enum-members is provided, a reassigned submission retains
    the reassigned status. For details, see the examples section.
