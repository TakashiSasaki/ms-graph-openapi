  summary: Invoke action unsubmit
  description: >-
    Indicate that a student wants to work on the submission of the assignment
    after it was turned in. Only teachers, students, and applications with
    application permissions can perform this operation. This method changes the
    status of the submission from submitted to working. During the submit
    process, all the resources are copied from submittedResources to 
    workingResources. The teacher will be looking at the working resources list
    for grading. A teacher can also unsubmit a student's assignment on their
    behalf.
