  summary: Invoke action publish
  description: >-
    Publish an education assignment. Change the status of an educationAssignment
    from its original draft status to the published status.  You can change the
    status from draft to scheduled if the assignment is scheduled for a future
    date.  Only a teacher in the class can make this call. When an assignment is
    in draft status, students will not see the assignment, nor will there be any
    submission objects. Calling this API creates educationSubmission objects and
    displays the assignment in each student's list. The status of the assignment
    goes back to draft if there is any backend failure during publish process.
    To update the properties of a published assignment, see update an
    assignment.
