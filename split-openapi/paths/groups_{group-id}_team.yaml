  summary: Create team from group
  description: >-
    Create a new team under a group. In order to create a team, the group must
    have a least one owner. If the creation of the team call is delayed, you can
    retry the call up to three times before you have to wait for 15 minutes due
    to a propagation delay. If the group was created less than 15 minutes ago,
    the call might fail with a 404 error code due to replication delays. If the
    group was created less than 15 minutes ago, it's possible for a call to
    create a team to fail with a 404 error code, due to ongoing replication
    delays.

    The recommended pattern is to retry the Create team call three times, with a
    10 second delay between calls.
