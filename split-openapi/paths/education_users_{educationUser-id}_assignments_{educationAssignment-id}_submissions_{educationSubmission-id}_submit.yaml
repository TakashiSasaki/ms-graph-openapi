    Indicate that a student is done with the work and is ready to hand in the
    assignment. Only teachers, students, and applications with application
    permissions can perform this operation. This method changes the status of
    the submission from working to submitted. During the submit process, all the
    resources are copied to the submittedResources bucket. The teacher will be
    looking at the submitted resources list for grading. A teacher can also
    submit a student's assignment on their behalf.
