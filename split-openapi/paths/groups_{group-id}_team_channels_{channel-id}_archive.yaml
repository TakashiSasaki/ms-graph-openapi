  summary: Invoke action archive
  description: >-
    Archive a channel in a team. When a channel is archived, users can't send
    new messages or react to existing messages in the channel, edit the channel
    settings, or make other changes to the channel. You can delete an archived
    channel or add and remove members from it. If you archive a team, its
    channels are also archived. Archiving is an asynchronous operation; a
    channel is archived after the asynchronous archiving operation completes
    successfully, which might occur after the response returns. A channel
    without an owner or that belongs to a group that has no owner, can't be
    archived. To restore a channel from its archived state, use the channel:
    unarchive method. A channel canâ€™t be archived or unarchived if its team is
    archived.
