  summary: Invoke action completeMigration
  description: >-
    Complete the message migration process by removing migration mode from a
    channel in a team. Migration mode is a special state that prevents certain
    operations, like sending messages and adding members, during the data
    migration process. After a completeMigration request is made, you can't
    import additional messages into the team. You can add members to the team
    after the request returns a successful response.
