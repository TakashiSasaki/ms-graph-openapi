  summary: Invoke action excuse
  description: >-
    Excuse a submission. Excused submissions aren't included in average grade
    calculations. Grading rubrics and feedback are deleted. Only teachers can
    perform this action.  If the Prefer: include-unknown-enum-members request
    header is provided, the excused submission shows the excused status.
    Otherwise, the submission status retains the returned status. For more
    information about how to use this header, see the Examples section.
