  summary: List outcomes
  description: >-
    Retrieve a list of educationOutcome objects. There are four types of
    outcomes: educationPointsOutcome, educationFeedbackOutcome,
    educationRubricOutcome, and educationFeedbackResourceOutcome. Only teachers,
    students, and applications with application permissions can perform this
    operation. A submission for a credit assignment (one that has no point value
    and no rubric) has an educationFeedbackOutcome. (It might also return an
    educationPointsOutcome, but that outcome is ignored.) A submission for a
    points assignment (one that has a point value assigned) has both an
    educationFeedbackOutcome and an educationPointsOutcome. A submission for an
    assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a credit rubric (no
    points), has an educationFeedbackOutcome and an educationRubricOutcome. (It
    might also return an educationPointsOutcome, but that outcome is ignored.) A
    submission for an assignment with an attached rubric, if the rubric is a
    points rubric, has an educationFeedbackOutcome, an educationPointsOutcome,
    and an educationRubricOutcome. A submission for a feedback resource has an
    educationFeedbackResourceOutcome. All outcome types have a regular and a
    published property appropriate to that type of outcome; for example, points
    and publishedPoints, feedback and publishedFeedback. The regular property is
    the most recent value updated by the teacher; the published property is the
    most recent value returned to the student.

  summary: Create educationFeedbackResourceOutcome
  description: >-
    Create a new feedback resource for a submission. Only a teacher can perform
    this operation. To create a new file-based resource, upload the file to the
    feedback resources folder associated with the assignment. If the file
    doesn't exist or isn't in that folder, the POST request will fail.
