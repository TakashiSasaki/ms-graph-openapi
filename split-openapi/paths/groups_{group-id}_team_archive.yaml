  summary: Invoke action archive
  description: >-
    Archive the specified team. 

    When a team is archived, users can no longer make most changes to the team.
    For example, users can no longer: send or like messages on any channel in
    the team; edit the team's name or description; nor edit other settings.
    However, membership changes to the team are still allowed. Archiving is an
    async operation. A team is archived once the async operation completes
    successfully, which might occur subsequent to a response from this API. To
    archive a team, the team and group must have an owner. To restore a team
    from its archived state, use the API to unarchive.
