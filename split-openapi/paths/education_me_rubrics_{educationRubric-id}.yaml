  summary: Update educationRubric
  description: >-
    Update the properties of an educationRubric object. Only teachers can
    perform this operation. Updating a rubric attached to an assignment (PATCH
    /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/rubric) is only
    possible before the assignment is published, and what is updated is actually
    the original rubric that exists under /education/users/{id}/rubrics. After
    the assignment is published, an immutable copy of the rubric is made that is
    attached to that specific assignment. That rubric can be retrieved using GET
    /education/classes/{class-id}/assignments/{assignment-id}/rubric, but it
    can't be updated.
