  summary: List submission resources
  description: >-
    List the resources associated with a submission. Only teachers, students,
    and applications with application permissions can perform this operation.
    The educationSubmissionResource object is a wrapper around the actual
    resource object the student is working on. The wrapper also includes a
    pointer to the resources on the assignment if this resource was copied from
    the assignment during the assign process. These resources are the working
    copy of the assignment. The submittedResources are the resources that were
    officially submitted for grading.

  summary: Create educationSubmissionResource
  description: >-
    Add an educationSubmissionResource to a submission resource list. Only
    teachers and students can perform this operation. The operation will not
    succeed if the allowStudentsToAddResources flag is not set to true. To
    create a new file-based resource, upload the file to the resources folder
    associated with the submission. If the file doesn't exist or is not in that
    folder, the POST request will fail.
