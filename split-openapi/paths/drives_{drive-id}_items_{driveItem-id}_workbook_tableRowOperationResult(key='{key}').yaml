  summary: Invoke function tableRowOperationResult
  description: >-
    This function is the last in a series of steps to create a workbookTableRow
    resource asynchronously. A best practice to create multiple table rows is to
    batch them in one create tableRow operation and carry out the operation
    asynchronously. An asynchronous request to create table rows involves the
    following steps:

    1. Issue an async Create tableRow request and get the query URL returned in
    the Location response header.

    2. Use the query URL returned from step 1 to issue the Get workbookOperation
    request and get the operation ID for step 3. 
        Alternatively, for convenience, after you get a succeeded operationStatus result, you can get the query URL from the resourceLocation property of the workbookOperation returned in the response, and apply the query URL to step 3. 
    3. Use the query URL returned from step 2 as the GET request URL for this
    function tableRowOperationResult. A successful function call returns the new
    table rows in a workbookTableRow resource. This function does not do
    anything if called independently.
