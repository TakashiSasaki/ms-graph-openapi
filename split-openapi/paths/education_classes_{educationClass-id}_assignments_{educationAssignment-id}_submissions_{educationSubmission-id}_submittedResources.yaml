  summary: List submittedResources
  description: >-
    List the educationSubmissionResource objects that were officially submitted
    for grading. Only teachers, students, and applications with application
    permissions can perform this operation. The student who owns the submission
    can't change the submitted list without resubmitting the assignment. This
    resource is a wrapper around the real resource and can contain a pointer
    back to the actual assignment resource if this resource was copied from the
    assignment.
